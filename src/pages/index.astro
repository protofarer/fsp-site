            At the heart of Frontier Sports Performance is a simple truth:
            greatness begins with a foundation of physical and mental
            resilience. Founded by Steven Baron and Jonathan Locher, Frontier
            Sports Performance is the culmination of a lifelong journey in
            athletics, fueled by lessons learned on and off the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            Steven’s biggest career breakthroughs came from intense speed and
            weight training, which built not only his body but also his
            discipline and focus. At Frontier, this philosophy drives every
            program: starting with physical training to prime the body and mind,
            then honing skills for peak performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frontier Sports Performance empowers athletes to push limits,
            achieve breakthroughs, and become stronger in every way.
